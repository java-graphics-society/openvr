# openvr 
Java OpenVR binding

In sync with original OpenVR 1.02. It includes several enhances, like:

- `read()` moved inside `(Pointer peer)` constructors
- `SIZE` on geometric classes, such as `HmdMatrix34_t`
- `dataSize()` on `RenderModel_TextureMap_t`
- `set(..)` methods to avoid new instantiation on classes such as `Texture_t`

Steps:

- add jars under `\lib`
